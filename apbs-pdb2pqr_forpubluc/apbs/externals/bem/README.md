# TABIPB
This TABIPB repo serves as a submodule to APBS, and also works as a standalone distribution.

## Build Instructions
To build as an independent executable:
```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This creates a tabipb executable located at tabipb/build/bin/tabipb. To run an example, navigate to the examples directory, and run ../build/bin/tabipb:
```
cd example/
./../build/bin/tabipb
```

# Building TABIPB on APBS_Sphinx

This should be similar to the Geoflow build. To invoke TABIPB on Sphinx, you need to use the flag `-DENABLE_TABIPB_SPHINX=ON` when you run cmake. Command:

1. `cd APBS_SPHINX/plugins/TABIPB/src`
2. `mkdir build; cd build`
3. `cmake -DENABLE_TABIPB_SPHINX=ON ..`
4. `make`
5. `cp tabipb_sph.so ../..`
