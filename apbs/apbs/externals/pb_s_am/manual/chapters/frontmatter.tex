\textbf{Cover Illustration:} An exploded view of a Brome Mosaic Virus capsid 
composed of T = 1 particles (PDB: 1YC6), 
represented as collections of overlapping spheres, is shown. 
PB-SAM is a new semi-analytical approach to efficiently solve the 
linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation using multipole formalisms for overlapping spheres. 
The background shows the potential profile for an array of 601YC6 monomers computed using this method. \\
